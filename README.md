# Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) Website
Use JavaScript and Bootstrapping to create a UFO sightings page

## Overview of Project
Build an an HTML page that will allows for filtering UFO sighting data based on differient criteria. The use of filters allows us to select the specific data we are interested in including date, city, state, country or shape, which is a useful tool as the sightings have occurred across the world. 

## Summary
The final webpage is clean and allows the end user flexibility to select which pieces of data they are most interested in, by filtering through the broad data set. Users can easily search for sightings that occurred on a specific date or select only a certain shape, like triangles for example. The primary drawback of the search bar is validating the underlying sighting data, as we do not have a field that includes number of eye witnesses, which can cause data integrity issues. To further enhance the sight I recommend the following:
1. Include an additional field that shows if the sighting has been verified by another party
2. Add uploading capabilities so additional sightings can be added
